- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pavkoccino.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in CI/CD pipelines and automation in general. I also like to explore all kinds of DevOps technologies that come my way, but there is just so many that I take it slow and just dig a little bit into everything I need (Jenkins, Gitlab CI/CD, Docker, scripting - Python, Powershell, Batch).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I need, but mostly I focus on Flutter.
